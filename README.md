CandleKeep is a knowledge base system that gives AI agents direct access to your books—not just their memories of them. Like the legendary library fortress it's named after, CandleKeep preserves and provides knowledge, but for the age of artificial intelligence.

---

## The Problem

When we ask AI agents for help, they rely on what they learned during training—a snapshot of knowledge that grows more distant with each passing day. This creates several challenges:

**The Memory Limitation**: Just as you wouldn't ask a developer to code without access to documentation, we shouldn't expect agents to work optimally with only their training memory of books.

**The Code Analogy**: Developers using AI coding assistants know this intuitively—giving an agent access to your actual codebase produces vastly better results than relying on the agent to "remember" how libraries work from training time.

**Knowledge Shapes Decisions**: Your knowledge determines your actions. Ask an agent for investment advice without context, and you'll get generic results. But an agent with access to your library of value investing books will give fundamentally different advice than one working with crypto trading guides.

## The Solution

CandleKeep is your personal knowledge infrastructure for AI agents. It's not just a book storage system—it's a living library that learns from how you use it.

### Core Concepts

**Books as Context, Not Data**: CandleKeep treats books as source material that agents can reference, annotate, and connect—just like you would with your own library.

**Neurons That Fire Together, Wire Together**: CandleKeep tracks how you access different parts of books during work sessions. When you reference Chapter 3 of *Clean Code* while also consulting *Refactoring*, the system notes this connection. Over time, these patterns reveal insights unique to your knowledge journey.

**Personalized Intelligence**: Two people can have identical book collections but develop completely different insights based on how they use them. CandleKeep captures and amplifies your unique knowledge patterns.

**Knowledge Transfer Between Humans**: Power users can write "agent-optimized" books—guides specifically designed for AI consumption. Share your methodology for working with agents, your coding patterns, or your analytical frameworks with others by packaging your knowledge as books for their agents.

## Key Features

### Technology Stack

- **CLI Tool**: Python-based command-line interface for all operations
- **Parser**: Docling + LLM-powered content extraction and structuring
- **Storage**: MySQL database for books, annotations, and connection graphs
- **Integration**: Claude Code MCP plugin + skill for agent guidance
- **Session Tracking**: Activity logging for pattern analysis and insight generation

### How It Works

1. **Add a Book**: Import books in various formats; CandleKeep parses and structures the content
2. **Annotate & Connect**: As you work, add highlights, notes, and cross-references
3. **Agent Access**: Your AI agents can query the library, receiving context from your books
4. **Pattern Learning**: The system tracks which books/sections are accessed together during sessions
5. **Insight Emergence**: Over time, connection patterns reveal unique insights from your knowledge usage

## Use Cases

### 📈 Personalized Financial Advice
- **Scenario**: You ask an agent for investment strategy advice
- **Without CandleKeep**: Generic advice based on common knowledge
- **With CandleKeep**:
  - Value investing library → Advice focused on fundamental analysis, long-term holds
  - Crypto trading library → Advice on DeFi, yield farming, volatility strategies
  - Options trading library → Advice on hedging, spreads, risk management

### 💻 Coding Methodology Transfer
- **Scenario**: A senior developer shares their agentic coding approach
- **Process**:
  1. Write an "agent book" documenting TDD with AI pair programming techniques
  2. Share with team members who add it to their CandleKeep libraries
  3. Their agents now code using the senior developer's proven patterns
- **Result**: Institutional knowledge transferred at scale

### 🔬 Research & Cross-Referencing
- **Scenario**: Writing a paper on distributed systems
- **Workflow**: Reference *Designing Data-Intensive Applications*, *The Art of Scalability*, and various research papers
- **CandleKeep Advantage**:
  - Agents can pull relevant sections from all sources
  - Connection tracking shows which concepts you consistently link
  - Emerging patterns suggest novel connections you might explore

### 📚 Domain Expertise Building
- **Scenario**: Learning machine learning with agent assistance
- **Progression**:
  1. Add foundational texts (*Pattern Recognition*, *Deep Learning*)
  2. Add specialized books as you advance
  3. Your agent's responses evolve with your library
  4. Session tracking shows your learning path and knowledge gaps

### The Bigger Picture

CandleKeep is part of a shift in how we think about AI agents and knowledge. Just as the printing press democratized access to books, and the internet democratized access to information, we believe agent-accessible personal libraries will democratize access to personalized expertise.

**The hypothesis**: If human actions are determined by the knowledge they possess, then giving agents access to personalized, curated, and actively-used knowledge creates fundamentally different—and better—AI assistance.

## Why "CandleKeep"?

In Dungeons & Dragons lore, Candlekeep is a fortress library dedicated to the collection and preservation of knowledge. It's a place where seekers of wisdom come to learn, researchers come to discover, and knowledge is treated as sacred. Our CandleKeep aspires to the same principle: creating a sanctuary for knowledge in the age of artificial intelligence, where wisdom isn't just stored—it's actively used, connected, and amplified.

*Built with the belief that knowledge, when properly organized and accessed, reveals insights greater than the sum of its parts.*
